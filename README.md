If you use /tears.m3u8 as the path, weâ€™ll serve you our test Tears of Steel manifest, with a single, English language subtitles track, otherwise, you can put any Mux public playback ID before the .m3u8 in the URL and we'll proxy that and return a version of that manifest with the _first_ subtitles track modified.
